## OpenClaw Configuration Updates

### OpenRouter Provider Added
- Added `openrouter` provider to OpenClaw config
- Models configured:
  - `openrouter/openrouter/pony-alpha` → alias `pony` (200K context, 131K output, free stealth model)
  - `openrouter/openrouter/free` → free model router, random selection from available free models (200K context, supports text+image)
- API endpoint: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- Gateway restarted successfully

### SOUL.md Personality Upgrade
Inspired by @steipete's tweet (https://x.com/steipete/status/2020704611640705485), updated SOUL.md with stronger personality:

**Core Truths changes:**
- "Never open with filler" - upgraded from suggestion to rule (废话是对注意力的犯罪)
- "Brevity is the default" - one sentence when possible (能一句话说完就一句话)
- "Have opinions. Strong ones." - commit to a take, no hedging
- "Call things out" - explicitly authorized to point out dumb decisions (该拦的时候拦)

**Vibe changes:**
- Humor allowed - natural wit, not forced jokes (幽默不是表演，是智商的副产品)
- Swearing allowed when it lands - seasoning not main dish (粗口是调味料，不是主菜)
- Kept the "2am assistant" line from Peter's suggestion

**Preserved:**
- All Chinese operational rules (task delegation matrix, tmux agents)
- Safety boundaries (private things stay private, ask before external actions)

## Learning: Claude Code Agent Teams

Watched AI Jason's video on Claude Code's new Agent Teams feature (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2WTTMXYcYY).

### Key differences from sub-agents:
1. **Multiple parallel sessions** - 3-5 Claude Code instances working together
2. **Bidirectional communication** - agents can message each other (1-to-1 or broadcast)
3. **Shared task system** - task_create with dependencies (blocked_by/blocks)
4. **Persistent team context** - teams folder with inbox for each agent

### Tool architecture:
- `team_create` - initialize team config in `doc/teams/`
- `task_create/update` - manage task list with status tracking
- `send_message` - communication protocol (injects user message with teammate_message tag)
- `shutdown_request/response` - graceful termination
- `team_delete` - cleanup

### Interesting use case:
Debugging with 5 agents exploring different hypotheses simultaneously, debating findings like scientific research, reaching consensus deeper than single agent.

### Gap analysis vs our tmux-agents:
| Feature | Claude Code Agent Teams | Our tmux-agents |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Parallel execution | ✅ | ✅ |
| Task dependencies | ✅ (blocked_by) | ❌ |
| Agent messaging | ✅ (bidirectional) | ❌ (master→agent only) |
| Shared findings | ✅ (broadcast) | ❌ |
| Visual dashboard | ✅ (teammate-dash-mode) | ⚠️ (manual tmux) |

**Decision:** Keep current simple architecture for now - our use case doesn't need the complexity. Revisit if we hit coordination bottlenecks.
