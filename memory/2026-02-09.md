## Key Events

### Discord Channel Created
- Created `#latex` channel under "📚 研究" category
- Topic: "LaTeX 编辑：公式排版、模板调试、编译问题、格式调整"

### Curiosity Kernel Bug Fix
- **Problem discovered**: Curiosity Kernel was designed but not executing
  - `total_explorations: 0`, `last_touched: null` on all knowledge gaps
  - Tension index 0.6 > threshold 0.5, but no action taken
  
- **Root cause**: 
  1. HEARTBEAT.md too long, curiosity steps buried and skipped
  2. No state tracking file to enforce execution
  
- **Fix applied**:
  1. Created `memory/heartbeat-state.json` with `curiosity_loop_count` counter
  2. Simplified HEARTBEAT.md into actionable checklist format
  3. Made curiosity loop a "must execute" step with explicit tracking
  
- **Meta-discovery #002**: 
  > 任何需要"定期执行"的逻辑，必须有显式的状态追踪和不可忽略的触发机制。光写在文档里没用。
  
- **Lesson**: Design ≠ Execution. Need mechanical enforcement for periodic tasks.

### Model Switch
- Switched to `openrouter/pony-alpha` at 23:02

### Gateway Briefly Offline
- Gateway restarted at ~05:40, causing brief Discord bot disconnection
- Logs showed `Unknown interaction` errors during restart window

## Files Modified
- `HEARTBEAT.md` - Simplified to checklist format
- `memory/heartbeat-state.json` - Created for tracking
- `curiosity-kernel/state.json` - Updated stats
- `curiosity-kernel/discoveries.md` - Added discovery #002

## Open Items
- Still need to actually explore the highest-priority knowledge gaps (edge intelligence, HARL project)
- Bird CLI authentication still broken (prediction: won't fix itself)
