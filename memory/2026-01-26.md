- Neil decision: For macOS-only skills, implement via a "remote-macos proxy skill" approach (execute on LAN macOS host neardws@192.168.31.171 over SSH), rather than trying to run macOS-only binaries on Linux.
- Neil preference: For any planning/roadmap/complex multi-step request, generate the plan via local `droid exec` (read-only by default) using model `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`, then execute with main model.
- Neil preference: Use MiniMax (`cheap` alias) as default sub-agent model for high-volume/low-risk/parallelizable work (research/collection, batch text processing, draft variants, read-only repo reconnaissance). Do not delegate sensitive actions/final decisions/complex planning.
