## Ten Years · Stars and Rust

![LA Blue Hour](/content/blog/images/lalaland-griffith-observatory.jpg)

When La La Land was released in 2016, I don't quite remember if I watched it in the cinema or if it wasn't released in mainland China—I watched it on my computer at some point, then caught it during the re-release at the cinema. At the time, I knew nothing about jazz, but I remember Sebastian's line:

> "It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's just... it's new every time. It's brand new every night."

Ten years later, it's Valentine's Day again. Now it's February 14, 2026—the second time I've watched La La Land in a theater. The theater was nearly empty (fewer than 10 people). When the lights came on at the end, I felt an inexplicable emptiness—not disappointment, but that dazed feeling after reliving a beautiful dream.

The Los Angeles on screen remains that dreamy "City of Stars," Griffith Park's sunset still paints the skyline red, the Hollywood sign still glitters at night. But I found I couldn't fully immerse myself in the film's romance anymore—not because the movie changed, but because my view of the world changed.

2016 was Obama's final year in office. The U.S. economy was slowly recovering from the financial crisis, Silicon Valley's tech boom was in full swing, and Hollywood was still the dream factory. "The American Dream" didn't yet sound like an irony. Los Angeles was the promised land for countless dreamers. Sebastian's line in the film—"Do you remember Louis Armstrong? He could have just played the marching band charts he was given, but what did he do instead? He made history"—felt like a love letter to all dreamers.

What about 2026? Deportation flights have hit record highs, ICE raids have become routine news, and the U.S.—once seen as the "land of opportunity"—now frequently appears in discussions about "Kill Lines" and "going home." Of course, movies are movies, reality is reality—the LA sunset doesn't change color with political winds, Griffith Observatory still stands atop the hill. But it's hard to pretend the "City of Stars" dream remains intact.

Interestingly, the 2016 film itself planted something prophetic. Sebastian is a struggling jazz pianist who can't hold down a stable job, can't even afford car insurance—but he insists on opening a place called "Chicken on a Stick." Yes, that ridiculous name is serious, just to preserve pure jazz. The film doesn't hide his poverty and狼狈—Sebastian has an almost stubborn idealism that might be worthless in reality, but I think it's precious enough to break your heart.

Looking back ten years later, this idealist's dilemma seems more common than ever. It's not just jazz that's "dying"—many things we once took for granted are becoming "heritage." In the film, Sebastian's friend Keith has already moved toward a less pure form of jazz, with more electronic and pop-influenced sounds. This line Keith says behind Sebastian's back stuck with me:

> "How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist? You hold onto the past, but jazz is about the future."

In 2016, this sounded like a friendly reminder. Ten years later, it feels like an omen of the times. The tension between "holding on" and "adapting" isn't just an artistic choice—it's become a matter of survival.

## Jazz · Decay and Persistence

![Sebastian playing piano still](/content/blog/images/lalaland-sebastian-piano.jpg)

It's not an overstatement to say La La Land is a film about jazz. Director Damien Chazelle practically wrote a love letter to jazz with this movie.

The most touching thing about Sebastian isn't his talent—it's his religious devotion to jazz. There's a scene where Seb plays a restaurant's agreed-upon Christmas曲目 at a fancy restaurant. The manager, for some reason, hates "Free Jazz." Seb starts improvising a jazz piece that has nothing to do with Christmas atmosphere—Mia & Sebastian's Theme—the same song that brings Seb and Mia together for the second time. But the restaurant manager fires Seb during the Christmas season. Seb walks out without looking back, ignoring Mia's greeting.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7AOGhYuYHOQamMtyZwgIw6?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

This scene takes only a few shots but defines Sebastian as a character. He's not unwilling to compromise—he simply won't. In his world, jazz isn't just a music genre—it's an attitude toward living. Every performance is new, every improvisation is an adventure. "It's very, very exciting!" His eyes light up when he says this. Yet jazz faces its own challenges:

> Sebastian: "They worship everything and they value nothing."

But Chazelle doesn't turn Sebastian into a simple "idealist martyr." He makes him face real dilemmas: no money, no audience, no way out. Seb's sister Laura is right—he wasn't "kidnapped," he was scammed. He can't open that jazz club, he can't even afford rent.

Sebastian and Keith's ideological confrontation gets to the heart of the matter:

> Keith: "How are you gonna be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist? You hold onto the past, but jazz is about the future."

Sebastian insists on "purity"—but does that purity have vitality in the present? Keith represents "fusion," a way to keep jazz alive—but is that still jazz?

Sebastian eventually joins Keith's band. He needs stable income. The film doesn't glorify this choice—Seb playing those "safe" pop hits on stage has an inexplicable emptiness in his eyes. He gained stability but lost his soul.

But the ending is warm. Five years later, Seb actually opens his own jazz club "Seb's"—the name Mia gave him. The place is packed, people come for real jazz. When Mia walks in, Sebastian plays their song, Mia & Sebastian's Theme, on stage.

Did jazz "die"? No. At least not in the film. It took Sebastian five years, but he found a smarter way to become who he wanted to be. This is the best footnote to "Here's to the fools who dream"—not blindly crashing into walls, but finding a way after the crash.

**Sidebar: The Fate of the Musical**

Interestingly, jazz's dilemma is also what the musical film genre is facing. I'm a huge fan of musicals—Moulin Rouge!, Chicago, The Greatest Showman—these are all movies I love. Musicals were once Hollywood's signature genre; Singin' in the Rain and West Side Story are classics. But today, musicals have become "niche"—there are only a handful of live-action musical releases per year. La La Land's arrival once made many hope for a musical revival, but a decade later, the market for genre films hasn't changed much.

Perhaps it's exactly this "outdated" quality that gives La La Land its unique retro beauty. It's like a love letter to "the good old days"—charming and bittersweet.

## Love · Dreams and Choices

![Dancing still](/content/blog/images/lalaland-dancing.jpg)

Seb and Mia's love is the backbone of the entire film.

Their meeting wasn't romantic—Sebastian and Mia "argue" on the highway because he honked his horn, Mia's first impression of him was terrible. The second meeting was at a restaurant; Mia says hello to Seb but gets ignored, completely awkward. The third meeting is at a party where Mia requests "I Ran"—which completely breaks the "serious musician" Seb's defenses, but it also leads to Seb and Mia's first conversation.

But love doesn't care about your prepared script.

What follows is a romance for the ages: dancing under the stars at the observatory, sunset at Griffith Park, impromptu performances at a café. Seb takes Mia to hear real jazz; Mia goes from "I hate jazz" to "I like jazz now, because of you." This is the best kind of love—because of one person, you open a door you never thought you'd walk through.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1Vk4yRsz0iBzDiZEoFMQyv?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

But the most honest thing about this film is that it doesn't give love a perfect fairy tale ending.

When Mia is preparing for her one-woman show, Seb is touring with the band. They argue at home, and Seb says the most hurtful thing:

> Sebastian: "Maybe you liked me more when I was a failure because it made you feel better about yourself."

 Seb misses Mia's one-woman show because of a band photo shoot, and loses Mia. Of course, Seb later goes to find Mia and convinces her to audition for a film. Mia gets the job and goes to Paris. Five years later, she's a famous actress, married to someone else, with children. She and Sebastian meet again—at Seb's jazz club "Seb's."

That scene is the most magical part of the entire film. Sebastian plays that song, and the screen starts flashing back. If they hadn't separated, if they'd ended up together—what would it have been like? They would have married, had children, taken the kids to the park on Sunday afternoons, kissed at sunset, been together forever.

Then the music ends and the dream wakes. Mia has her husband beside her, Seb is on stage. They look at each other and smile, saying nothing.

> Mia: "I'm always gonna love you."
>
> Sebastian: "I'm always gonna love you, too."

Some people may love each other but cannot be together.

I've always wondered why Chazelle wrote the ending this way. Is it because he's not romantic enough? Quite the opposite. I think he understands better than anyone—true romance isn't "they lived happily ever after," it's "I'll always remember the moments we had together." Our lives are made of countless moments; as long as those moments were real at the time, they don't need to last forever.

Neither Seb nor Mia gave up their dreams for love. This is the cruelest and most honest part of the film. Mia didn't stay in LA for Seb; Seb didn't give up his jazz for Mia. They each moved forward, toward their own starry seas, then randomly reunited one day in the future, calmly letting go, at peace.

This is adult love—not either/or choices, but取舍 each makes independently.

## Fools · Tribute and Release

![Audition still](/content/blog/images/lalaland-audition.jpg)

If La La Land has only one theme, it's this song:

> "Here's to the fools who dream
> Crazy as they may seem
> Here's to the hearts that break
> Here's to the mess we make"

"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)" is the eye of the film.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/07zTXw1ZpmT6Lv1fZ13ElP?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

In the climax of the film, Mia stands in the audition room and sings this song. She tells the story of her aunt:

> "My aunt used to live in Paris. I remember, she used to come home and tell us stories about being abroad. And I remember she told us that she jumped into the river once..."

Mia's aunt may not have achieved "success" by worldly standards. But she jumped into the Seine in winter—she had one moment of recklessness. Mia's eyes light up when she tells these stories. I was deeply moved when I first heard it, puzzled about why she jumped into the Seine. Later I thought about it—jumping into the Seine is probably what "The Fools Who Dream" do.

This song is for the aunt, and for all "fools." Those who pursue dreams regardless, those who are misunderstood, those who keep smiling and say "one more time" after every crash.

Seb is a fool. He could earn stable money but insists on opening a jazz club that nobody might come to.

Mia is a fool. She dropped out of law school, works as a café front desk at Warner Bros., gets rejected in auditions over and over.

But it's precisely these "fools" that make up the most precious things in this world.

Watching this film again after ten years, I finally understand the meaning of that "fantasy scene" at the end. It's not unresolved longing—it's release. Seb and Mia each achieved their dreams; they didn't end up together, but that doesn't mean their love failed. They were the most important people in each other's dream-chasing journeys, the reason each other kept going. This kind of love is deeper than "being together."

## In Closing

Watching La La Land on Valentine's Day is a bit strange. This film isn't about a happy ending—it's about another form of love.

Between then and now, the dreaming and struggling in the film are no longer stories on screen—they're things I experience every day. I'm not as stubborn as Sebastian, not as brave as Mia, but I understand that impulse to "want to do something."

La La Land doesn't tell me "dreams will definitely come true"—it's not that naive. What it tells me is: those foolish dreamers, those who jumped into the Seine, those who crash and bleed for their ideals—their madness isn't wasted.

Perhaps one day, like Sebastian, we'll all open our own "Seb's." Perhaps by then, the person sitting beside us won't be the one who watched sunset with us at Griffith Observatory anymore. But that's not important. What matters is—we once dreamed that dream together.

> "Here's to the fools who dream."

Also, may we all find what we're passionate about:

> Mia: "People love what other people are passionate about."

🎉 Here's to all the foolish dreamers.
