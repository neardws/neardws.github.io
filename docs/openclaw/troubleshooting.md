Troubleshooting 🔧

When OpenClaw misbehaves, here’s how to fix it. Start with the FAQ’s [First 60 seconds](/help/faq#first-60-seconds-if-somethings-broken) if you just want a quick triage recipe. This page goes deeper on runtime failures and diagnostics. Provider-specific shortcuts: [/channels/troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting)

## 

​

Status & Diagnostics

Quick triage commands (in order):

Command| What it tells you| When to use it  
---|---|---  
`openclaw status`| Local summary: OS + update, gateway reachability/mode, service, agents/sessions, provider config state| First check, quick overview  
`openclaw status --all`| Full local diagnosis (read-only, pasteable, safe-ish) incl. log tail| When you need to share a debug report  
`openclaw status --deep`| Runs gateway health checks (incl. provider probes; requires reachable gateway)| When “configured” doesn’t mean “working”  
`openclaw gateway probe`| Gateway discovery + reachability (local + remote targets)| When you suspect you’re probing the wrong gateway  
`openclaw channels status --probe`| Asks the running gateway for channel status (and optionally probes)| When gateway is reachable but channels misbehave  
`openclaw gateway status`| Supervisor state (launchd/systemd/schtasks), runtime PID/exit, last gateway error| When the service “looks loaded” but nothing runs  
`openclaw logs --follow`| Live logs (best signal for runtime issues)| When you need the actual failure reason  
  
**Sharing output:** prefer `openclaw status --all` (it redacts tokens). If you paste `openclaw status`, consider setting `OPENCLAW_SHOW_SECRETS=0` first (token previews). See also: [Health checks](/gateway/health) and [Logging](/logging).

Common Issues

### 

​

No API key found for provider “anthropic”

This means the **agent’s auth store is empty** or missing Anthropic credentials. Auth is **per agent** , so a new agent won’t inherit the main agent’s keys. Fix options:

  * Re-run onboarding and choose **Anthropic** for that agent.
  * Or paste a setup-token on the **gateway host** :

Copy
[code]openclaw models auth setup-token --provider anthropic
        
[/code]

  * Or copy `auth-profiles.json` from the main agent dir to the new agent dir.

Verify:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw models status
    
[/code]

### 

​

OAuth token refresh failed (Anthropic Claude subscription)

This means the stored Anthropic OAuth token expired and the refresh failed. If you’re on a Claude subscription (no API key), the most reliable fix is to switch to a **Claude Code setup-token** and paste it on the **gateway host**. **Recommended (setup-token):**

Copy
[code]
    # Run on the gateway host (paste the setup-token)
    openclaw models auth setup-token --provider anthropic
    openclaw models status
    
[/code]

If you generated the token elsewhere:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw models auth paste-token --provider anthropic
    openclaw models status
    
[/code]

More detail: [Anthropic](/providers/anthropic) and [OAuth](/concepts/oauth).

### 

​

Control UI fails on HTTP (“device identity required” / “connect failed”)

If you open the dashboard over plain HTTP (e.g. `http://<lan-ip>:18789/` or `http://<tailscale-ip>:18789/`), the browser runs in a **non-secure context** and blocks WebCrypto, so device identity can’t be generated. **Fix:**

  * Prefer HTTPS via [Tailscale Serve](/gateway/tailscale).
  * Or open locally on the gateway host: `http://127.0.0.1:18789/`.
  * If you must stay on HTTP, enable `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth: true` and use a gateway token (token-only; no device identity/pairing). See [Control UI](/web/control-ui#insecure-http).



### 

​

CI Secrets Scan Failed

This means `detect-secrets` found new candidates not yet in the baseline. Follow [Secret scanning](/gateway/security#secret-scanning-detect-secrets).

### 

​

Service Installed but Nothing is Running

If the gateway service is installed but the process exits immediately, the service can appear “loaded” while nothing is running. **Check:**

Copy
[code]
    openclaw gateway status
    openclaw doctor
    
[/code]

Doctor/service will show runtime state (PID/last exit) and log hints. **Logs:**

  * Preferred: `openclaw logs --follow`
  * File logs (always): `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log` (or your configured `logging.file`)
  * macOS LaunchAgent (if installed): `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/logs/gateway.log` and `gateway.err.log`
  * Linux systemd (if installed): `journalctl --user -u openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service -n 200 --no-pager`
  * Windows: `schtasks /Query /TN "OpenClaw Gateway (<profile>)" /V /FO LIST`

**Enable more logging:**

  * Bump file log detail (persisted JSONL):

Copy
[code]{ "logging": { "level": "debug" } }
        
[/code]

  * Bump console verbosity (TTY output only):

Copy
[code]{ "logging": { "consoleLevel": "debug", "consoleStyle": "pretty" } }
        
[/code]

  * Quick tip: `--verbose` affects **console** output only. File logs remain controlled by `logging.level`.

See [/logging](/logging) for a full overview of formats, config, and access.

### 

​

”Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local”

This means the config exists but `gateway.mode` is unset (or not `local`), so the Gateway refuses to start. **Fix (recommended):**

  * Run the wizard and set the Gateway run mode to **Local** :

Copy
[code]openclaw configure
        
[/code]

  * Or set it directly:

Copy
[code]openclaw config set gateway.mode local
        
[/code]


**If you meant to run a remote Gateway instead:**

  * Set a remote URL and keep `gateway.mode=remote`:

Copy
[code]openclaw config set gateway.mode remote
        openclaw config set gateway.remote.url "wss://gateway.example.com"
        
[/code]


**Ad-hoc/dev only:** pass `--allow-unconfigured` to start the gateway without `gateway.mode=local`. **No config file yet?** Run `openclaw setup` to create a starter config, then rerun the gateway.

### 

​

Service Environment (PATH + runtime)

The gateway service runs with a **minimal PATH** to avoid shell/manager cruft:

  * macOS: `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/bin`
  * Linux: `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/bin`

This intentionally excludes version managers (nvm/fnm/volta/asdf) and package managers (pnpm/npm) because the service does not load your shell init. Runtime variables like `DISPLAY` should live in `~/.openclaw/.env` (loaded early by the gateway). Exec runs on `host=gateway` merge your login-shell `PATH` into the exec environment, so missing tools usually mean your shell init isn’t exporting them (or set `tools.exec.pathPrepend`). See [/tools/exec](/tools/exec). WhatsApp + Telegram channels require **Node** ; Bun is unsupported. If your service was installed with Bun or a version-managed Node path, run `openclaw doctor` to migrate to a system Node install.

### 

​

Skill missing API key in sandbox

**Symptom:** Skill works on host but fails in sandbox with missing API key. **Why:** sandboxed exec runs inside Docker and does **not** inherit host `process.env`. **Fix:**

  * set `agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.env` (or per-agent `agents.list[].sandbox.docker.env`)
  * or bake the key into your custom sandbox image
  * then run `openclaw sandbox recreate --agent <id>` (or `--all`)



### 

​

Service Running but Port Not Listening

If the service reports **running** but nothing is listening on the gateway port, the Gateway likely refused to bind. **What “running” means here**

  * `Runtime: running` means your supervisor (launchd/systemd/schtasks) thinks the process is alive.
  * `RPC probe` means the CLI could actually connect to the gateway WebSocket and call `status`.
  * Always trust `Probe target:` \+ `Config (service):` as the “what did we actually try?” lines.

**Check:**

  * `gateway.mode` must be `local` for `openclaw gateway` and the service.
  * If you set `gateway.mode=remote`, the **CLI defaults** to a remote URL. The service can still be running locally, but your CLI may be probing the wrong place. Use `openclaw gateway status` to see the service’s resolved port + probe target (or pass `--url`).
  * `openclaw gateway status` and `openclaw doctor` surface the **last gateway error** from logs when the service looks running but the port is closed.
  * Non-loopback binds (`lan`/`tailnet`/`custom`, or `auto` when loopback is unavailable) require auth: `gateway.auth.token` (or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`).
  * `gateway.remote.token` is for remote CLI calls only; it does **not** enable local auth.
  * `gateway.token` is ignored; use `gateway.auth.token`.

**If`openclaw gateway status` shows a config mismatch**

  * `Config (cli): ...` and `Config (service): ...` should normally match.
  * If they don’t, you’re almost certainly editing one config while the service is running another.
  * Fix: rerun `openclaw gateway install --force` from the same `--profile` / `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` you want the service to use.

**If`openclaw gateway status` reports service config issues**

  * The supervisor config (launchd/systemd/schtasks) is missing current defaults.
  * Fix: run `openclaw doctor` to update it (or `openclaw gateway install --force` for a full rewrite).

**If`Last gateway error:` mentions “refusing to bind … without auth”**

  * You set `gateway.bind` to a non-loopback mode (`lan`/`tailnet`/`custom`, or `auto` when loopback is unavailable) but didn’t configure auth.
  * Fix: set `gateway.auth.mode` \+ `gateway.auth.token` (or export `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) and restart the service.

**If`openclaw gateway status` says `bind=tailnet` but no tailnet interface was found**

  * The gateway tried to bind to a Tailscale IP (100.64.0.0/10) but none were detected on the host.
  * Fix: bring up Tailscale on that machine (or change `gateway.bind` to `loopback`/`lan`).

**If`Probe note:` says the probe uses loopback**

  * That’s expected for `bind=lan`: the gateway listens on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces), and loopback should still connect locally.
  * For remote clients, use a real LAN IP (not `0.0.0.0`) plus the port, and ensure auth is configured.



### 

​

Address Already in Use (Port 18789)

This means something is already listening on the gateway port. **Check:**

Copy
[code]
    openclaw gateway status
    
[/code]

It will show the listener(s) and likely causes (gateway already running, SSH tunnel). If needed, stop the service or pick a different port.

### 

​

Extra Workspace Folders Detected

If you upgraded from older installs, you might still have `~/openclaw` on disk. Multiple workspace directories can cause confusing auth or state drift because only one workspace is active. **Fix:** keep a single active workspace and archive/remove the rest. See [Agent workspace](/concepts/agent-workspace#extra-workspace-folders).

### 

​

Main chat running in a sandbox workspace

Symptoms: `pwd` or file tools show `~/.openclaw/sandboxes/...` even though you expected the host workspace. **Why:** `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode: "non-main"` keys off `session.mainKey` (default `"main"`). Group/channel sessions use their own keys, so they are treated as non-main and get sandbox workspaces. **Fix options:**

  * If you want host workspaces for an agent: set `agents.list[].sandbox.mode: "off"`.
  * If you want host workspace access inside sandbox: set `workspaceAccess: "rw"` for that agent.



### 

​

”Agent was aborted”

The agent was interrupted mid-response. **Causes:**

  * User sent `stop`, `abort`, `esc`, `wait`, or `exit`
  * Timeout exceeded
  * Process crashed

**Fix:** Just send another message. The session continues.

### 

​

”Agent failed before reply: Unknown model: anthropic/claude-haiku-3-5”

OpenClaw intentionally rejects **older/insecure models** (especially those more vulnerable to prompt injection). If you see this error, the model name is no longer supported. **Fix:**

  * Pick a **latest** model for the provider and update your config or model alias.
  * If you’re unsure which models are available, run `openclaw models list` or `openclaw models scan` and choose a supported one.
  * Check gateway logs for the detailed failure reason.

See also: [Models CLI](/cli/models) and [Model providers](/concepts/model-providers).

### 

​

Messages Not Triggering

**Check 1:** Is the sender allowlisted?

Copy
[code]
    openclaw status
    
[/code]

Look for `AllowFrom: ...` in the output. **Check 2:** For group chats, is mention required?

Copy
[code]
    # The message must match mentionPatterns or explicit mentions; defaults live in channel groups/guilds.
    # Multi-agent: `agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns` overrides global patterns.
    grep -n "agents\\|groupChat\\|mentionPatterns\\|channels\\.whatsapp\\.groups\\|channels\\.telegram\\.groups\\|channels\\.imessage\\.groups\\|channels\\.discord\\.guilds" \
      "${OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH:-$HOME/.openclaw/openclaw.json}"
    
[/code]

**Check 3:** Check the logs

Copy
[code]
    openclaw logs --follow
    # or if you want quick filters:
    tail -f "$(ls -t /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-*.log | head -1)" | grep "blocked\\|skip\\|unauthorized"
    
[/code]

### 

​

Pairing Code Not Arriving

If `dmPolicy` is `pairing`, unknown senders should receive a code and their message is ignored until approved. **Check 1:** Is a pending request already waiting?

Copy
[code]
    openclaw pairing list <channel>
    
[/code]

Pending DM pairing requests are capped at **3 per channel** by default. If the list is full, new requests won’t generate a code until one is approved or expires. **Check 2:** Did the request get created but no reply was sent?

Copy
[code]
    openclaw logs --follow | grep "pairing request"
    
[/code]

**Check 3:** Confirm `dmPolicy` isn’t `open`/`allowlist` for that channel.

### 

​

Image + Mention Not Working

Known issue: When you send an image with ONLY a mention (no other text), WhatsApp sometimes doesn’t include the mention metadata. **Workaround:** Add some text with the mention:

  * ❌ `@openclaw` \+ image
  * ✅ `@openclaw check this` \+ image



### 

​

Session Not Resuming

**Check 1:** Is the session file there?

Copy
[code]
    ls -la ~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/
    
[/code]

**Check 2:** Is the reset window too short?

Copy
[code]
    {
      "session": {
        "reset": {
          "mode": "daily",
          "atHour": 4,
          "idleMinutes": 10080 // 7 days
        }
      }
    }
    
[/code]

**Check 3:** Did someone send `/new`, `/reset`, or a reset trigger?

### 

​

Agent Timing Out

Default timeout is 30 minutes. For long tasks:

Copy
[code]
    {
      "reply": {
        "timeoutSeconds": 3600 // 1 hour
      }
    }
    
[/code]

Or use the `process` tool to background long commands.

### 

​

WhatsApp Disconnected

Copy
[code]
    # Check local status (creds, sessions, queued events)
    openclaw status
    # Probe the running gateway + channels (WA connect + Telegram + Discord APIs)
    openclaw status --deep
    
    # View recent connection events
    openclaw logs --limit 200 | grep "connection\\|disconnect\\|logout"
    
[/code]

**Fix:** Usually reconnects automatically once the Gateway is running. If you’re stuck, restart the Gateway process (however you supervise it), or run it manually with verbose output:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw gateway --verbose
    
[/code]

If you’re logged out / unlinked:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw channels logout
    trash "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}/credentials" # if logout can't cleanly remove everything
    openclaw channels login --verbose       # re-scan QR
    
[/code]

### 

​

Media Send Failing

**Check 1:** Is the file path valid?

Copy
[code]
    ls -la /path/to/your/image.jpg
    
[/code]

**Check 2:** Is it too large?

  * Images: max 6MB
  * Audio/Video: max 16MB
  * Documents: max 100MB

**Check 3:** Check media logs

Copy
[code]
    grep "media\\|fetch\\|download" "$(ls -t /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-*.log | head -1)" | tail -20
    
[/code]

### 

​

High Memory Usage

OpenClaw keeps conversation history in memory. **Fix:** Restart periodically or set session limits:

Copy
[code]
    {
      "session": {
        "historyLimit": 100 // Max messages to keep
      }
    }
    
[/code]

## 

​

Common troubleshooting

### 

​

“Gateway won’t start — configuration invalid”

OpenClaw now refuses to start when the config contains unknown keys, malformed values, or invalid types. This is intentional for safety. Fix it with Doctor:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw doctor
    openclaw doctor --fix
    
[/code]

Notes:

  * `openclaw doctor` reports every invalid entry.
  * `openclaw doctor --fix` applies migrations/repairs and rewrites the config.
  * Diagnostic commands like `openclaw logs`, `openclaw health`, `openclaw status`, `openclaw gateway status`, and `openclaw gateway probe` still run even if the config is invalid.



### 

​

“All models failed” — what should I check first?

  * **Credentials** present for the provider(s) being tried (auth profiles + env vars).
  * **Model routing** : confirm `agents.defaults.model.primary` and fallbacks are models you can access.
  * **Gateway logs** in `/tmp/openclaw/…` for the exact provider error.
  * **Model status** : use `/model status` (chat) or `openclaw models status` (CLI).



### 

​

I’m running on my personal WhatsApp number — why is self-chat weird?

Enable self-chat mode and allowlist your own number:

Copy
[code]
    {
      channels: {
        whatsapp: {
          selfChatMode: true,
          dmPolicy: "allowlist",
          allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
        },
      },
    }
    
[/code]

See [WhatsApp setup](/channels/whatsapp).

### 

​

WhatsApp logged me out. How do I re‑auth?

Run the login command again and scan the QR code:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw channels login
    
[/code]

### 

​

Build errors on `main` — what’s the standard fix path?

  1. `git pull origin main && pnpm install`
  2. `openclaw doctor`
  3. Check GitHub issues or Discord
  4. Temporary workaround: check out an older commit



### 

​

npm install fails (allow-build-scripts / missing tar or yargs). What now?

If you’re running from source, use the repo’s package manager: **pnpm** (preferred). The repo declares `packageManager: "pnpm@…"`. Typical recovery:

Copy
[code]
    git status   # ensure you’re in the repo root
    pnpm install
    pnpm build
    openclaw doctor
    openclaw gateway restart
    
[/code]

Why: pnpm is the configured package manager for this repo.

### 

​

How do I switch between git installs and npm installs?

Use the **website installer** and select the install method with a flag. It upgrades in place and rewrites the gateway service to point at the new install. Switch **to git install** :

Copy
[code]
    curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --install-method git --no-onboard
    
[/code]

Switch **to npm global** :

Copy
[code]
    curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
    
[/code]

Notes:

  * The git flow only rebases if the repo is clean. Commit or stash changes first.
  * After switching, run:

Copy
[code]openclaw doctor
        openclaw gateway restart
        
[/code]




### 

​

Telegram block streaming isn’t splitting text between tool calls. Why?

Block streaming only sends **completed text blocks**. Common reasons you see a single message:

  * `agents.defaults.blockStreamingDefault` is still `"off"`.
  * `channels.telegram.blockStreaming` is set to `false`.
  * `channels.telegram.streamMode` is `partial` or `block` **and draft streaming is active** (private chat + topics). Draft streaming disables block streaming in that case.
  * Your `minChars` / coalesce settings are too high, so chunks get merged.
  * The model emits one large text block (no mid‑reply flush points).

Fix checklist:

  1. Put block streaming settings under `agents.defaults`, not the root.
  2. Set `channels.telegram.streamMode: "off"` if you want real multi‑message block replies.
  3. Use smaller chunk/coalesce thresholds while debugging.

See [Streaming](/concepts/streaming).

### 

​

Discord doesn’t reply in my server even with `requireMention: false`. Why?

`requireMention` only controls mention‑gating **after** the channel passes allowlists. By default `channels.discord.groupPolicy` is **allowlist** , so guilds must be explicitly enabled. If you set `channels.discord.guilds.<guildId>.channels`, only the listed channels are allowed; omit it to allow all channels in the guild. Fix checklist:

  1. Set `channels.discord.groupPolicy: "open"` **or** add a guild allowlist entry (and optionally a channel allowlist).
  2. Use **numeric channel IDs** in `channels.discord.guilds.<guildId>.channels`.
  3. Put `requireMention: false` **under** `channels.discord.guilds` (global or per‑channel). Top‑level `channels.discord.requireMention` is not a supported key.
  4. Ensure the bot has **Message Content Intent** and channel permissions.
  5. Run `openclaw channels status --probe` for audit hints.

Docs: [Discord](/channels/discord), [Channels troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting).

### 

​

Cloud Code Assist API error: invalid tool schema (400). What now?

This is almost always a **tool schema compatibility** issue. The Cloud Code Assist endpoint accepts a strict subset of JSON Schema. OpenClaw scrubs/normalizes tool schemas in current `main`, but the fix is not in the last release yet (as of January 13, 2026). Fix checklist:

  1. **Update OpenClaw** :
     * If you can run from source, pull `main` and restart the gateway.
     * Otherwise, wait for the next release that includes the schema scrubber.
  2. Avoid unsupported keywords like `anyOf/oneOf/allOf`, `patternProperties`, `additionalProperties`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `format`, etc.
  3. If you define custom tools, keep the top‑level schema as `type: "object"` with `properties` and simple enums.

See [Tools](/tools) and [TypeBox schemas](/concepts/typebox).

## 

​

macOS Specific Issues

### 

​

App Crashes when Granting Permissions (Speech/Mic)

If the app disappears or shows “Abort trap 6” when you click “Allow” on a privacy prompt: **Fix 1: Reset TCC Cache**

Copy
[code]
    tccutil reset All bot.molt.mac.debug
    
[/code]

**Fix 2: Force New Bundle ID** If resetting doesn’t work, change the `BUNDLE_ID` in [`scripts/package-mac-app.sh`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/scripts/package-mac-app.sh) (e.g., add a `.test` suffix) and rebuild. This forces macOS to treat it as a new app.

### 

​

Gateway stuck on “Starting…”

The app connects to a local gateway on port `18789`. If it stays stuck: **Fix 1: Stop the supervisor (preferred)** If the gateway is supervised by launchd, killing the PID will just respawn it. Stop the supervisor first:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw gateway status
    openclaw gateway stop
    # Or: launchctl bootout gui/$UID/bot.molt.gateway (replace with bot.molt.<profile>; legacy com.openclaw.* still works)
    
[/code]

**Fix 2: Port is busy (find the listener)**

Copy
[code]
    lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN
    
[/code]

If it’s an unsupervised process, try a graceful stop first, then escalate:

Copy
[code]
    kill -TERM <PID>
    sleep 1
    kill -9 <PID> # last resort
    
[/code]

**Fix 3: Check the CLI install** Ensure the global `openclaw` CLI is installed and matches the app version:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw --version
    npm install -g openclaw@<version>
    
[/code]

## 

​

Debug Mode

Get verbose logging:

Copy
[code]
    # Turn on trace logging in config:
    #   ${OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH:-$HOME/.openclaw/openclaw.json} -> { logging: { level: "trace" } }
    #
    # Then run verbose commands to mirror debug output to stdout:
    openclaw gateway --verbose
    openclaw channels login --verbose
    
[/code]

## 

​

Log Locations

Log| Location  
---|---  
Gateway file logs (structured)| `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log` (or `logging.file`)  
Gateway service logs (supervisor)| macOS: `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/logs/gateway.log` \+ `gateway.err.log` (default: `~/.openclaw/logs/...`; profiles use `~/.openclaw-<profile>/logs/...`)  
Linux: `journalctl --user -u openclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service -n 200 --no-pager`  
Windows: `schtasks /Query /TN "OpenClaw Gateway (<profile>)" /V /FO LIST`  
Session files| `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/agents/<agentId>/sessions/`  
Media cache| `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/media/`  
Credentials| `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/credentials/`

​

Health Check

Copy
[code]
    # Supervisor + probe target + config paths
    openclaw gateway status
    # Include system-level scans (legacy/extra services, port listeners)
    openclaw gateway status --deep
    
    # Is the gateway reachable?
    openclaw health --json
    # If it fails, rerun with connection details:
    openclaw health --verbose
    
    # Is something listening on the default port?
    lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN
    
    # Recent activity (RPC log tail)
    openclaw logs --follow
    # Fallback if RPC is down
    tail -20 /tmp/openclaw/openclaw-*.log
    
[/code]

## 

​

Reset Everything

Nuclear option:

Copy
[code]
    openclaw gateway stop
    # If you installed a service and want a clean install:
    # openclaw gateway uninstall
    
    trash "${OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.openclaw}"
    openclaw channels login         # re-pair WhatsApp
    openclaw gateway restart           # or: openclaw gateway
    
[/code]

⚠️ This loses all sessions and requires re-pairing WhatsApp.

Browser Not Starting (Linux)

If you see `"Failed to start Chrome CDP on port 18800"`: **Most likely cause:** Snap-packaged Chromium on Ubuntu. **Quick fix:** Install Google Chrome instead:

Copy
[code]
    wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
    
[/code]

Then set in config:

Copy
[code]
    {
      "browser": {
        "executablePath": "/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable"
      }
    }
    
[/code]
