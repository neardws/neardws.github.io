Xincao Xu (Chinese character 许新操 or 許新操), also known as Neil Xu received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the College of Computer Science at Chongqing University (<a href="https://www.cqu.edu.cn" class="no-underline">CQU</a>), Chongqing, China, in 2023. He previously earned his B.S. degree in Network Engineering from the School of Computer and Control Engineering at the North University of China (<a href="https://www.nuc.edu.cn" class="no-underline">NUC</a>), Taiyuan, China, in 2017. Dr. Xu is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, working in cooperation with Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IhjhNEEAAAAJ" class="no-underline">Shaohua Wan</a> at the Shenzhen Institute for Advanced Study, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (<a href="https://www.uestc.edu.cn" class="no-underline">UESTC</a>), in Shenzhen. He has authored and co-authored more than 15 papers with total google scholar <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DK5avZUAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FNeardws%2Fneardws.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=Citations"></a>. 
       
His research interests are primarily focused on several cutting-edge areas, including: 
- AI for Driving, covering aspects like heterogeneous information fusion, cooperative sensing, multimodal deep learning, and driving behavior control.
- Vehicular Networks, with a focus on cooperative transmission and computing, integrated sensing and communications, and resource allocation.
- Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems, encompassing sensing, transmitting, modeling, and controlling.
- Edge Computing, emphasizing the offloading of communication, computing, and caching abilities from the cloud to the network edge.
- Deep Reinforcement Learning, including multi-agent DRL, hierarchical DRL, and the integration of DRL with other technologies such as game theory and evaluation algorithms.
- Game Theory, with a specific interest in potential games, matching, auctions, and related concepts.
